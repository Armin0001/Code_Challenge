## Project Workflow and Features
What I've done is, I've first selected the color pallete which I'm going to use. Then I configured that.  
After that has been done, I've selected the fonts. After the fonts have been selected it was time to move on the the next phase, that is  
to import the api and see it working in action. I've probably spent about 3 hours setting everything up.  
Links for colors

For fonts:

The api was probably done after or before the breadcrumbs component. In any case, after all of that, the next step was to add in the filter.  
After successfull implementation of the filter, the page looked done.  
But there was just one more thing left to do - style everything.  
So I've used the colors, the fonts, from previous steps and made everything look nice.  
The final step was to add in the mobile responsivness and that was it.
